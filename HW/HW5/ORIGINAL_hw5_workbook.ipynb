    "In Weeks 8 and 9 you discussed key concepts related to graph based algorithms and implemented SSSP. In this final homework assignment you'll implement distributed PageRank using some data from Wikipedia. You will likely want to select 16 or 32 cores when you set up your cluster, as graph processing with Spark can take some time. If you are working on free trial credits, then you maximum will be 16 cores. You'll also need to enable GraphFrames when you spin up your cluster or you won't be able to complete the last question.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __compare/contrast__ adjacency matrices and lists as representations of graphs for parallel computation.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the goal of the PageRank algorithm using the concept of an infinite Random Walk.\n",
    "* ... __define__ a Markov chain including the conditions underwhich it will converge.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what modifications must be made to the web graph inorder to leverage Markov Chains.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ distributed PageRank in Spark."

    "\n",
    "As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. \n",

What is the value in the middle column of the last row (the probability of transitioning from node `E` to `C`)? Include the leading digit in front of the decimal, and round the number to at least 4 decimal places. Examples: 1.0000 or 0.1234. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]\n",

Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. \n",
