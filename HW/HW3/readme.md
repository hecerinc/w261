# Homework 3: Synonym Detection In Spark

How to submit your work:
To complete this Homework  assignment you will need to submit your responses on the Canvas assignment form located here for HW3 located [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/4745907/assignments).

We strongly recommend completing and saving all responses in the Homework notebook first, before attempting to submit the assignment responses in Canvas, because:

* All responses in Canvas must be submitted at once (i.e. on Canvas you can't save a half-completed assignment and come back later). For full marks you will be required to upload an HTML and .ipynb version of your notebooks on the Canvas form, so it will need to be completed before submission.

Tips: Make use of your peers and TAs by asking questions on Slack. Everyone comes to MIDs from a different background so don't be shy; all questions are welcome!

The HW file structure should look like this:
