# Homework 4: Gradient Descent at Scale

In this homework you will perform distributed linear regression in Spark and delve into the effects of different kinds of regularization.


We strongly recommend completing and saving all responses in the Homework notebook first, before attempting to submit the assignment responses in Canvas, because:

All responses in Canvas must be submitted at once (i.e. on Canvas you can't save a half-completed assignment and come back later). For full marks you will be required to upload an HTML and .ipynb version of your notebooks on the Canvas form, so it will need to be completed before submission.

Tips: Make use of your peers and TAs by asking questions on Slack. Everyone comes to MIDs from a different background so don't be shy; all questions are welcome!
